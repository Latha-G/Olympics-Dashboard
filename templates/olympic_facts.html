          At its 1986 Session in Lausanne, the IOC decided to introduce a change where the summer and winter games were no longer held in the same year. 
          From 1924 to 1992, the Summer and Winter Games were each held in the same year, every four years. 
          This four years period is called the "Olympiad". The last Summer and Winter Games held in the same 
          year were in Barcelona (Summer) and Albertville (Winter) in 1992. Since then, the Summer and Winter 
          Games are each still held every four years but the Summer Games are celebrated during the first year 
          of an Olympiad and the Winter Games held in the third year.
